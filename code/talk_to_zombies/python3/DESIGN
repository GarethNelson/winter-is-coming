server
   handles connections (duh)
   handles game session spawning
   each connection can have either a lobby state, ingame state or endgame state
   lobby state:
      can create or join a game session
   ingame state:
      is updated with events from ingame (game session sends events to the server object, server object adds to per-connection queue)
         gameover event skips other events
      can send shoot commands
      at gameover, enters endgame state
   endgame state:
      entered when game is over, all players are told who won (either a player or the zombie)
      can go back to lobby or disconnect
      if no command for 10 seconds, defaults to disconnect

game session
   uses coroutine to implement zombie
        every second, zombie moves to new location
   command queue for players
        server/protocol can add shoot commands to the queue
